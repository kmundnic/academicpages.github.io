I'm a final year PhD Candidate at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab](https://sail.usc.edu/) (SAIL) at the University of Southern California.

My interests lie broadly in machine learning. During my PhD, my focus has been in machine learning applied to human and animal behavior.

Outside of work, I enjoy backpacking, cycling, skiing, [photography](https://www.500px.com/kmundnic) (mostly street and landscape), and design.
